## Game Idea in a sentence
Shoot down flies with different combinations of bubbles.

## Game goal
- Down all the flies
- Collect as much points as possible
  - Amount of hit/downed flies
  - Amount of combos (chain downs)
  - Remaining gums (?)

## Gameplay Flow
1. **Select a gum**
   - Gum type amount limited
   - Select one gum
   - Different knockback strengths
   - Type ideas:
     - Simple
       - No spetial effects
       - Easy to chew
     - Heavy
       - Drags more down
       - Harder to chew
     - Explosive
       - Throws flies further / Larger area of pop
       - Harder to chew
       - (Explodes in your mouth when you fail rythmus)
     - Chain
       - Splits in smaller bubbles when hit
       - Normal to chew
     - Wet gum
       - Slows down speed
2. **Chew the gum by completing rythm mini-game**
   - Influences how much gas can be pumpt into the gum
       - The bar over the gas selection gets bigger
   - Can stop at any time
   - Length/Difficulty depends on gum combination
3. **Fill with different gases that influence the gum**
   - Influences:
     - Flight speed
     - Gum size
     - Flight pattern
   - Different gases fill gap by different amounts
4. **Influence targeting and release**
   - Move head up/down
       - Influences release height
   - Click to release
       - Fine tune timing

## Flies
- When weight threshold is reached, they fall down/get knocked back
- While knocked back, when they hit another fly, it "sticks" with it and receives weight (gum weight + fly weight)
- **Properties**
  - Weight threshold
  - Speed
  - Dodge speed (influenced by weight + speed)
  - Dodge radius
  - Knockback strength (How far away they fly)
- **Fly type ideas:**
  - Simple fly
    - Basic size/stats
  - Heavy fly
    - Hight weight threshold
    - Bigger in size
  - Small fly
    - Harder to hit
    - Small in size/collider
  - Fast fly
    - Fast dodge speed
  - Bee
    - Don't hit the friendly bee
  - Slimy fly
    - Losses gum (weight) over time
  - Burning fly
    - Must be hit with extra wet gum to remove fire
    - When on fire, gums have no effect
